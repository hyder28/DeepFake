# DeepFake Image Detection
By: Hyder Ali

### 1. Problem Statement
With the rapid development of technology in the field of AI, deepfake technology has emerged as a double-edged sword. It has not only created a large amount of AI-generated content but also posed unprecedented challenges to digital security.
### 2. Task Description
Multi-dimensional Facial Forgery Image Dataset (Multi-FFI) is used for the image Deepfake detection. The Multi-FFI dataaset is built on the "Technical Specifications for Financial Applications of Fake Digital Face Detection" launched by Ant Group. At the same time, it is deeply combined with the actual defensive experience in the digital business to include truly diversified deep forgery attacks including face-swapping, activation, attribute editing, full-face synthesis, audio-driving face generation, face restoration, digital adversial samples, automated PS, and other common types. More than 50 Deepfake generation methods are applied to the entire data set. In addition to the classic GANs model, the generation model also fully covers the new generative AI model of the Diffusion series such as image-to-image generation, text-to-image generation, etc. 

The task is to determine whether a face image is a Deepfake image and output its probability score of being a Deepfake image.
